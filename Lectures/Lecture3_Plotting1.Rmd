## Lecture

One of the things people love about working in **R** is the ability to quickly make and change high-quality plots. And it's true!  Plotting is awesome and fun, and you will find yourself doing a bunch of it.  

We'll look mainly at plotting with the main **R** graphics (called "base **R**"), and also briefly preview a different set of plotting tools called **ggplot2** (which has a totally different syntax that can be confusing, but that makes great graphics. ggplot2 is part of a larger suite of tools known as the *tidyverse* or *tidyR*, which is super useful but super different from base **R**, so I'll not mention it for now. Shhh...pretend I said nothing.)

Here again, we'll use code from the *Pirate's Guide*, and annotate it as necessary.  

#### How to think about basic plotting in **R**

* A plot is like a canvas, and you can only work on one canvas at a time
* Some functions (like *plot()*) call entirely new canvases, others (like *points()*) add stuff to existing canvases
* The important thing isn't the plot; it's the code that made the plot. You can always quickly make a new graphic if you have the code. 


```{r basicplot}
# A basic scatterplot
plot(x = 1:10,  #this creates a vector from one to 10
     y = 1:10,  #this does the same
     xlab = "X Axis label",
     ylab = "Y Axis label",
     main = "Main Title")
```

Note that in the code we've specified the *x* and *y* variables (they are numeric vectors, in this case), and the *plot()* function knows we want to plot them against one another. 

* If the vectors weren't the same length, what would happen?  

```{r plotting error, error=TRUE}
plot(y=1:10, x=1:11)
```

As seen above, it doesn't make any sense to plot two vectors against one another if they aren't the same length.

Note also that you can use *plot()* by specifying *x* and *y*, as above `plot(x = 1:10, y=1:10)` OR equivalently by using formula notation `plot(y~x)`. If we've already defined *x* and *y* somewhere else, it's clear what to plot.  For example:

```{r}
x = seq(0,6.5, 0.1)  #this creates a numeric vector from 0 to 6.5 by increments of 0.1
y = sin(x)  #this takes the sin(x)
plot(y~x)
```

If we haven't defined the variables elsewhere, we can call them by specifying a dataframe that they came from.  For example:

```{r}
plot(height~weight, data=pirates)

#or equivalently,

plot(pirates$height~pirates$weight)

```



Note also -- as shown above -- that if you don't specify a title or *x* or *y* axis labels, that's OK... the plot just is a bit boring, but **R** still makes the plot for you.

### Customizing plots

#### Scale

You might want to play with the x- or y-scales.  Keeping our same plot as above, we can do this easily with the arguments *ylim()* and *xlim()* by providing a two-number vector: the min and max you want to see shown on the graph.

```{r}
plot(height~weight, 
     data=pirates, 
     ylim=c(150,160), 
     xlim=c(50,80)
     )
```

#### Plotting Character

Now, let's say you want to plot in squares instead of circles. Sure. You can do that. Or filled circles.  Or whatever.  There's an argument for that, called *pch*, which stands for "plot character".  

Using the code from the *Pirate's Guide*: 

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The symbol types associated with the pch plotting parameter.", fig.width = 3, fig.height = 3, fig.align= 'center'}
par(mar  = c(1, 1, 3, 1))  #here, we are changing the margins, which you don't need to worry about yet

plot(x = rep(1:5 + .1, each = 5),  #create an x vector by repeating some numbers 5 times each
     y = rep(5:1, times = 5),      #same for y
     pch = 1:25,      #plot characters 1 through 25 (this is to show you the different plot characters)
     xlab = "", ylab = "", xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n",  #remove x and y axes and labels 
     xlim = c(.5, 5.5),  #set the min/max x-axis limits
     ylim = c(0, 6),    #set the min/max y-axis limits
     bty = "n", bg = "gray", cex = 1.4,   #don't make a box around the figure, make the background gray, and make the plot characters 1.4 times their normal sizes
     main = "pch = _"   #create a title 
     )

text(x = rep(1:5, each = 5) - .35,   #now add text to that same plot to label each plotting character
     y = rep(5:1, times = 5),
     labels = 1:25, cex = 1.2
     )
```

And you can even decide you want to plot using letters or other character strings, by giving *pch* a character instead of a numeral. For example, if today we really like the letter W...

```{r}

plot(x = 1:10,       #let x be the integers 1:10
     y = rnorm(10),  #let y be 10 random numbers from a normal distribution (w default mean = 0, sd = 1)
     pch = "w",      #use the plotting character "w"
     xlab = "",      #remove the x axis label
     ylab = "")      #remove the y axis label

```

#### Color

**R** has infinite color options; some are built-in, and you can generate new ones yourself.   To borrow again from the *Pirate's Guide*:

>The easiest way to specify a color is to enter its name as a string. For example `col = "red"` is R's default version of the color red. Of course, all the basic colors are there, but R also has tons of quirky colors like `"snow"`, `"papayawhip"` and `"lawngreen"`. Figure \@ref(fig:randomcolors) shows 100 randomly selected named colors.

```{r randomcolors, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 7, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="100 random named colors (out of all 657) in R."}
set.seed(100)
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(1, xlim = c(0, 11), ylim = c(0, 11), 
     type = "n", bty = "n", xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", 
     xlab = "", ylab = "")

loc <- expand.grid(x = 1:10, y = 1:10)
col.vec <- colors()[sample(1:length(colors()), size = 100)]

for(i in 1:nrow(loc)) {
  x.i <- loc$x[i]
  y.i <- loc$y[i]
  rect(x.i - .5, y.i - .5, 
       x.i + .5, y.i + .5,
       col = col.vec[i], border = "white")

  text(x.i, y.i, labels = col.vec[i], cex = .6)
}
```


> To see all 657 color names in R, run the code `colors()`. Or to see an interactive demo of colors, run `demo("colors")`.

Some awesome people have created color palettes based on movies, directors, etc. The *wesanderson* set of palettes might be my favorite. For example:

```{r}
library(wesanderson)

wes_palette("Zissou1")  #show the colors in the wesanderson palette "Zissou1"

x <- seq(0, 7, 0.01)  #create a sequence of numbers from 0 to 7 by units of 0.01
y <- sin(x)  #calculate the sin(x)

plot(y~x,
     col=wes_palette("Zissou1")[1],  #note: wes_palette() is a function. 
                                      # using this function with the argument "Zissou1" generates 5 colors,
                                      #and here, we're using a numerical index, [1], to say which color we want
     pch=19) #make the sine plot, but using the first 
              #Zissou1 color and use solid circles as the plot character 
abline(h=0,
      col=wes_palette("Zissou1")[5],
      lwd = 2) #draw a horizontal line at y = 0, using a Zissou1 color
abline(h=0.5,
      col=wes_palette("Zissou1")[3],
      lwd = 2,
      lty = 4) #draw a horizontal line at y = 0.5, using a Zissou1 color, 
                #and make it a dashed line (lty ... "for line type")
abline(h=-0.5,
      col=wes_palette("Zissou1")[4],
      lwd = 2,
      lty = 4) #draw a horizontal line at y = -0.5, using a Zissou1 color, 
                #and make it a dashed line (lty ... "for line type")

```

#### Many more parameters

See ?par for the complete set of base **R** plotting parameters. You can change just about anything about a graph: font, margins, rotation of labels, etc.


### Non-Scatterplots

Life isn't all about scatterplots, of course.  Let's see some other useful kinds of plots, again quoting from the *Pirate's Guide*:


>Histogram: `hist()`

| Argument| Description| 
|:------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
|`x`|Vector of values|
|`breaks`| How should the bin sizes be calculated? Can be specified in many ways (see `?hist` for details)|
|`freq`| Should frequencies or probabilities be plotted? `freq = TRUE` shows frequencies, `freq = FALSE` shows probabilities.|
|`col`, `border`| Colors of the bin filling (`col`) and border (`border`)|

Table: (\#tab:hist) `hist()` function arguments

>Histograms are the most common way to plot a vector of numeric data. To create a histogram we'll use the `hist()` function. The main argument to `hist()` is a `x`, a vector of numeric data. If you want to specify how the histogram bins are created, you can use the `breaks` argument. To change the color of the border or background of the bins, use `col` and `border`:

>Let's create a histogram of the weights in the ChickWeight dataset:

```{r}
hist(x = ChickWeight$weight,
     main = "Chicken Weights",
     xlab = "Weight",
     xlim = c(0, 500))
```


>We can get more fancy by adding additional arguments like `breaks = 20` to force there to be 20 bins, and `col = "papayawhip"` and `bg = "hotpink"` to make it a bit more colorful:



```{r}
hist(x = ChickWeight$weight,
     main = "Fancy Chicken Weight Histogram",
     xlab = "Weight",
     ylab = "Frequency",
     breaks = 20, # 20 Bins
     xlim = c(0, 500),
     col = "papayawhip", # Filling Color
     border = "hotpink") # Border Color
```


If you want to plot two histograms on the same plot, for example, to show the distributions of two different groups, you can use the \texttt{add = TRUE} argument to the second plot. 

```{r}
hist(x = ChickWeight$weight[ChickWeight$Diet == 1],
     main = "Two Histograms in one",
     xlab = "Weight",
     ylab = "Frequency",
     breaks = 30,
     xlim = c(0, 500),
     col = gray(0, .5))

hist(x = ChickWeight$weight[ChickWeight$Diet == 2],
     breaks = 30,
     add = TRUE, # Add plot to previous one...
                  #note this LOOKS like a stacked bar chart, but is not!
                  #it is merely one histogram in front of another.
                  #which is dangerous, because it hides data.
     col = gray(1, .8))
```

#### And More

You get the point.  For any plot you can imagine (and more), there's a way to do it in **R**.  People have created additional packages for things like *waffleplots* , *network diagrams* and all kinds of things.

### ggplot2

We're going to look more at this in two weeks, but just as a quick preview, there are other packages for **R** that people have created to create graphics in different ways. One of those is *ggplot2*, which has different syntax, and can make cool things like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis) #cool color palettes

levels(ChickWeight$Diet)<-c("Diet 1", "Diet 2", "Diet 3", "Diet 4")  #relabel Diet categories for clarity in graphing
  ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x=Time, y=weight, color=Chick))+
    geom_line()+
    facet_grid(~Diet)+
    guides(color=guide_legend(ncol=4))+
    labs(color="Chick")+
    ggtitle("Chick Weight by Time and Diet")
  
  
  ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x=Time, y=weight, color=Diet))+
    geom_point()+
    geom_smooth() +
    ggtitle("Mean Chick Weight by Time and Diet") +
    scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
  

```
